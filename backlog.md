# Chamber — Backlog

## Now

- [ ] **Session timeout recovery** `bug` — idle chat gives "Session not found" when CLI session gets harvested. Detect stale session errors, auto-create new session transparently, show "reconnecting..." indicator. *(Kent feedback 2026-04-09)*
- [ ] **Agent doesn't load SOUL/memory on first message** `bug` — after genesis, saying "hi" doesn't trigger the agent to read SOUL.md and .working-memory files. Agent instructions not being injected into session context.
- [ ] **New Mind missing extensions/skills** `bug` — genesis bootstrap doesn't install extensions (cron, canvas, idea) or skills (commit, daily-report, etc.). New minds start bare.
- [ ] **Inject local time/timezone into every prompt** `bug` — agent should know the time without shelling out. Inject `current_datetime` and timezone into each `session.send()`. SDK has a `current_datetime` section in the prompt template.
- [ ] **Teams Agency MCP issue** `bug` — Kent reported problem with Teams MCP proxy; shared log in AET SWE Chat. Needs investigation. *(Kent, 2026-04-09)*
- [ ] **No Start Menu icon** `bug` — installer doesn't create Start Menu shortcut. Likely Electron Forge / Squirrel config in packaging step.
- [ ] **Upgrade genesis-created minds on open** `bug` — minds created via CLI genesis (not Chamber) may be missing lens defaults, lens skill, and other Chamber-specific bootstrapping. When a mind is opened in Chamber for the first time, detect and run `seedLensDefaults` + `installLensSkill` + any missing capabilities. *(Ian, 2026-04-12)*
- [ ] **Landing screen needs a back button** `ux` — when "Add Agent" navigates to the landing screen, there's no way to go back if you change your mind. Add a back/cancel action that returns to the previous chat view. *(Ian, 2026-04-12)*

## Next

- [ ] **Chat history** `ux` — conversations are lost on new conversation or restart. Show past conversations per-mind in MindSidebar, indented under each agent. Data already in `~/.copilot/session-state/`. See [[conversation-history]] for spec. *(Ian, 2026-04-12)*
- [ ] **Boot screen activity log** `ux` — spinner too passive during genesis/startup; surface log output so user sees real-time progress. *(Kent feedback 2026-04-09)*
- [ ] **"Open Existing" defaults to ~/agents/** `ux` — folder picker should open to `$HOME/agents/` by default (where `MindScaffold.getDefaultBasePath()` creates minds).
- [ ] **Surface agent questions in chat** `ux` — #13, `onUserInputRequest` returns "Not available" — agent questions never reach the user.
- [ ] **Session startup performance** `perf` — pre-warm `getSharedClient()` at app launch (CLI spawn + auth in background while user is on landing screen). Also: session reuse via `resumeSession` API.
- [ ] **CSP and sandbox** `security` — add Content-Security-Policy via `onHeadersReceived`, enable `sandbox: true`. #1, #2.
- [ ] **Centralized IPC channel constants** `ipc` — `shared/ipc-channels.ts` with nested semantic namespacing (`IPC.CHAT.SEND`, `IPC.CONFIG.SAVE`).
- [ ] **Shared ElectronAPI type** `ipc` — single interface in `shared/electron-types.ts`, preload implements, renderer consumes. Kill `as unknown as` cast. #14.
- [ ] **Zod validation on IPC handlers** `ipc` `security` — schema validation on `config:save` and complex payloads. Preload stays passthrough. #4.
- [ ] **Test suite** `quality` — Vitest unit → IPC integration → Playwright E2E. No tests exist today.
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** `quality` — tag-based release workflow for multi-platform builds.

## Later

- [ ] **Unsaved changes indicator + Save button** `ux` — visual when mind has uncommitted changes; "Save" commits for execs who don't know git.
- [ ] **Multiple assistant personalities** `ux` — multiple agent personas in the voices screen. *(Kent feedback 2026-04-09)*
- [ ] **Agent alerts / notifications** `ux` — system toasts + taskbar flash via `notify` tool and/or CronMonitor service. Electron `new Notification()` + `BrowserWindow.flashFrame()`.
- [ ] **Scratch pad / work queue** `ux` — notepad for async handoff. User drops notes while agent is busy; agent triages when idle.
- [ ] **Agency MCP config** `lens` — Lens editor view over MCP server config.
- [ ] **Upgrade from genesis UI** `ux` — button/menu for discovering and installing genesis updates without typing a prompt.
- [ ] **Upgrade to Myelin memory** `arch` — migration from flat-file `.working-memory/` to `shsolomo/myelin` knowledge graph.
- [ ] **Move Responses API to frontier** `arch` — extract responses extension from genesis to frontier repo.
- [ ] **Intercom** `arch` — agent-to-agent communication on A2A protocol; evolves responses + yellow-pages.
- [ ] **Extension lib refactor** `arch` — shared lib for CLI extensions + Lens views.
- [ ] **Multi-window / multi-agent** `arch` — single host process, `MindManager` with `Map<mindPath, {session, extensions, window}>`. Fleet awareness, in-process A2A routing.
- [ ] **Connection health check** `arch` — real SDK health, not synthetic `mindPath !== null`. #12.
- [ ] **Harden mind path validation** `security` — traversal/symlink checks. #3.
- [ ] **Permission prompt flow** `security` — replace auto-approve with user prompt. #5.
- [ ] **Navigation guards** `security` — `will-navigate` + `setWindowOpenHandler` to block arbitrary URL navigation.
- [ ] **Electron Fuses audit** `security` — verify `RunAsNode: false`, `OnlyLoadAppFromAsar: true`, `EnableEmbeddedAsarIntegrityValidation: true`.
- [ ] **Per-domain handler modules** `ipc` — split handlers into `registerChatHandlers()`, `registerConfigHandlers()`, etc.
- [ ] **Listener cleanup audit** `ipc` — verify every `ipcRenderer.on()` returns unsub function. Wire into React effect cleanup.
- [ ] **Dynamic channels for extensions** `ipc` — chatbox MCP transport pattern for Chamber extensions. Per-instance channels with cleanup on close.
- [ ] **Lens view load time** `perf` — profile discovery scan, file reads, renderer-side rendering.
- [ ] **Replace AuthService C# with keytar** `quality` — native module for credential storage, cross-platform.
- [ ] **Gate console.log** `quality` — debug flag for 50+ log statements. #18.
- [ ] **Polish pass** `quality` — dark mode toggle, app icon, empty states.
