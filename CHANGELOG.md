# Changelog

## v0.25.0 (2026-04-18)

### Chatroom: orchestration strategies

- **5 orchestration modes** — Concurrent (parallel fan-out), Sequential (round-robin with accumulated context), GroupChat (moderator-directed with speaker selection), Handoff (agent-to-agent delegation with transcript), Magentic (manager-driven task ledger with step budget).
- **OrchestrationStrategy interface** — pluggable strategy pattern with `OrchestrationContext` adapter; adding a new mode requires zero changes to ChatroomService.
- **OrchestrationPicker UI** — mode selector with per-mode config dialogs (moderator, initial agent, manager, max hops/steps).
- **Shared stream-agent infrastructure** — extracted duplicated SDK event wiring, stale session retry, and send timeout into `stream-agent.ts`; shared XML/JSON helpers in `shared.ts`.
- **Approval gate** — configurable tool execution review gate for orchestrated sessions.
- **Structured observability** — event emission with parameter redaction for orchestration audit trails.

### Bug fixes

- **Session idle race condition** — `session.idle` and `session.error` listeners now register BEFORE `session.send()` in both ChatService and all 5 strategies, preventing missed events that caused 5-minute hangs.
- **Send timeout guard** — 30-second timeout on `session.send()` itself; if the call hangs (dead WebSocket), throws a stale session error triggering retry with a fresh session.
- **TypingIndicator alignment** — chatroom typing indicator now left-aligns with message content instead of centering.

## v0.24.0 (2026-04-17)

### Model picker

- **Fresh model list on every mind connect/switch** — removed the `useRef` one-shot cache in `useAppSubscriptions` that prevented new SDK models from appearing until restart. Models now fetch fresh whenever the active mind changes. (#97)

### Repo hygiene

- **Backlog migrated to GitHub Issues** — removed `backlog.md`; all 62 open items filed as issues #29–#90 with `now` / `next` / `later` priority labels. Open work is tracked on the issue tracker from here on.
- **Design notes promoted to discussion issue** — removed `docs/design-notes.md`; contents captured in #28 for inline commentary.

### SDK

- **CopilotClient runs with the mind folder as `cwd`** — `CopilotClientFactory.createClient` now forwards `mindPath` as the CLI process `cwd`. Previously the CLI inherited Electron's launch directory (often `C:\Windows\System32` when launched from Start Menu), so mind-local config like `.mcp.json`, `.copilot/`, and `AGENTS.md` was never discovered. Each mind now spawns its CLI inside its own folder.

## v0.23.0 (2026-04-16)

### Chat: turn-level work log

- **WorkGroup panel** — replaced the stack of per-tool and per-reasoning `Collapsible` cards with a single compact panel per turn. Each tool call and reasoning step is now a one-line entry (icon + heading + preview); click to expand the full output or reasoning body inline.
- **Streaming auto-expand** — the running tool in the active group auto-expands so its output is visible while it streams, and collapses back to a one-liner when done.
- **Truncation** — groups with more than 6 entries collapse the older ones behind a "Show N more" control.
- **Safer previews** — tool previews now pull only from an allowlisted set of argument keys (`command`, `path`, `file`, `query`, etc.) so sensitive-looking args like `token` / `apiKey` / `password` can't leak into the collapsed row.
- **Design notes** — rationale + locked architectural decisions captured in `docs/design-notes.md`.

## v0.22.0 (2026-04-16)

### Chat markdown rendering
- **Typography plugin** — registered `@tailwindcss/typography` via Tailwind v4 `@plugin` directive so `prose` classes now actually style headings, lists, tables, and blockquotes in chat messages.
- **Syntax highlighting** — added `rehype-highlight` with a `github-dark` theme for fenced code blocks.
- **External links** — markdown links now open in a new window with `rel=noopener noreferrer`.
- **Refined overrides** — cleaned up `.prose` CSS for inline vs block code chips and GFM tables.

## v0.21.0 (2026-04-16)

### Multi-account GitHub auth
- **Account selection** - Settings now lists all stored GitHub accounts, keeps the active account selected, and lets you add another account from the same picker.
- **Active login persistence** - Chamber now persists `activeLogin` in config so auth status resolves the intended credential instead of whichever one keytar returns first.
- **Full auth reload on switch** - Switching accounts reloads every mind so Copilot clients, chatroom sessions, and task sessions all restart with fresh auth state.
- **Targeted logout** - Logging out removes only the active credential and returns the app to the signed-out flow without auto-switching to another stored account.

## v0.20.0 (2026-04-15)

### Settings view and logout
- **Settings navigation** — added a bottom-pinned gear icon in the ActivityBar that opens a dedicated Settings view.
- **Account section** — Settings now shows the current GitHub login and a logout action in the app UI.
- **Logout flow** — logging out deletes the stored keytar credential, broadcasts the event to all windows, and returns AuthGate to the sign-in screen.

## v0.19.7 (2026-04-13)

### Lens discovery fix
- **Late-created lens folders** — Chamber now discovers lens views created after a mind was already loaded instead of requiring a manual reload.

## v0.19.6 (2026-04-13)

### Zero Lint / CI Green
- **ESLint clean** — resolved all errors and warnings across the codebase
- **CI `validate` job** — new workflow step runs `npm run lint` on every push and PR
- **Pre-commit hook** — lint check runs before each commit via Husky + lint-staged
- **Dependency updates** — eslint-plugin-import, TypeScript ESLint tooling refreshed

## v0.19.5 (2026-04-13)

### Final Message Drop Fix
- **Reducer `message_final` handler** — was checking `blocks.some(b => b.type === 'text')` which silently dropped final message content when any earlier text block existed. Now checks `b.sdkMessageId === event.sdkMessageId` so the agent's final response after tool calls is correctly added as a new TextBlock.

## v0.19.4 (2026-04-13)

### Session Timeout Recovery
- **Stale session detection** — `isStaleSessionError()` utility detects "Session not found" errors from harvested CLI sessions
- **ChatService retry** — catches stale session on `send()`, emits `reconnecting` event, recreates session via `MindManager.recreateSession()`, retries once
- **ChatroomService retry** — evicts stale session from cache, creates fresh session, retries broadcast once
- **TaskManager retry** — catches stale session on A2A task sends, creates fresh task session, rebinds listeners, retries once
- **MindManager** — `recreateSession()` now returns the new `CopilotSession` for caller use
- **`reconnecting` ChatEvent** — new event type for UI indicators during session recovery

## v0.19.0 (2026-04-13)

### Chatroom (Phase 5)
- **ChatroomService** — broadcast user messages to all loaded agents in parallel with isolated per-mind chatroom sessions
- **Round-based echo prevention** — agents respond to user messages only; previous round context injected as escaped XML `<chatroom-history>`
- **Session isolation** — chatroom sessions are separate from individual chat sessions (no context bleed)
- **Mid-round sends** — user can send while agents are still responding; incomplete responses cancelled automatically
- **Incremental persistence** — chatroom transcript saved to `~/.chamber/chatroom.json` with atomic writes (500 message cap)
- **ChatroomPanel UI** — single timeline with sender badges, colored agent avatars, participant bar with status indicators
- **Multi-agent streaming** — multiple agents stream simultaneously with independent progress tracking
- **Per-agent error isolation** — one agent failing doesn't affect others
- **ActivityBar navigation** — chatroom icon (Users) between Chat and Lens views

## v0.18.1 (2026-04-13)

### Structural Cleanup (Uncle Bob Review)
- **Deleted orphaned `agent.ts` IPC** — dead module that would crash on import (duplicate handlers)
- **Deleted `SdkLoader.ts` singleton** — superseded by `CopilotClientFactory`; migrated `MindScaffold` to use injected factory
- **Created `mind/` barrel export** — consistent with all other service directories
- **Fixed dependency direction** — A2A protocol types now defined in `shared/`, not re-exported from `main/`
- **Completed `agent:` namespace migration** — removed deprecated API, preload bindings, backward-compat IPC handlers; `useAgentStatus` hook now uses `mind:` namespace exclusively
- **Cleaned up `main.ts` composition root** — replaced `_restorePromise` as-any hack with proper `awaitRestore()` method; extracted event wiring into `wireLifecycleEvents()`
- **Moved `index.css`** to `src/renderer/` (renderer-only concern)
- **Removed duplicate `makeMessage`** helper from `store.test.ts`

## v0.18.0 (2026-04-13)

### A2A Tasks (Phase 4)
- **TaskManager service** — full A2A 8-state lifecycle (submitted → working → completed/failed/canceled/input-required/rejected/auth-required)
- **Isolated sessions per task** — `MindManager.createTaskSession()` creates independent conversation contexts
- **4 new agent tools** — `a2a_send_task`, `a2a_get_task`, `a2a_list_tasks`, `a2a_cancel_task`
- **Artifact extraction** — agent responses become A2A Artifacts with artifactId, name, parts[]
- **input-required flow** — SDK `onUserInputRequest` callback maps to A2A interrupted state, `resumeTask()` resumes
- **TaskPanel UI** — tasks grouped by agent, status badges, expand for artifacts, cancel button
- **Real-time IPC events** — `task:status-update` and `task:artifact-update` streamed to renderer
- **A2A conformity** — ListTasksResponse wrapper, required contextId, Artifact.extensions, AgentCard.iconUrl, AgentExtension type, historyLength semantics

### Fixes
- **Boot screen version** — pulls from package.json dynamically (was hardcoded 0.15.0)
- **TaskSessionFactory interface** — TaskManager depends on interface, not MindManager (DIP)
- **Typed IPC boundary** — ElectronAPI.a2a methods use real types, not `any`
- **Defensive copies** — all public TaskManager methods return snapshots
- **Task eviction** — MAX_COMPLETED_TASKS=100 prevents unbounded memory growth
- **Terminal-state guards** — assistant.message events don't mutate canceled tasks
- **Response accumulation** — multiple assistant messages accumulate in artifact text

## v0.17.0 (2026-04-13)

### A2A Messages (Phase 3)
- **MessageRouter** — in-process A2A routing mirroring SendMessage RPC
- **AgentCardRegistry** — A2A-conformant AgentCards from mind metadata
- **TurnQueue** — per-mind turn serialization preventing session.send() races
- **2 agent tools** — `a2a_send_message` (fire-and-forget), `a2a_list_agents`
- **Sender attribution** — SenderBadge component shows "↪ from Agent A" on incoming messages
- **XML prompt serialization** — structured envelope for model injection
- **Hop-count loop protection** — per-contextId tracking, MAX_HOPS=5
- **Per-mind streaming state** — A2A on one mind doesn't block another's UI

## v0.16.0 (2026-04-12)

### Agent Windowing (Phase 2)
- **Pop-out windows** — right-click agent in sidebar → "Open in New Window"
- **Window management** — `MindManager.attachWindow()`/`detachWindow()`
- **Independent renderers** — each window gets its own chat panel
- **Closing popout** doesn't unload the mind

## v0.15.0 (2026-04-12)

### Multi-Mind Runtime (Phase 1)
- **MindManager** — aggregate root with `Map<mindId, InternalMindContext>`
- **CopilotClientFactory** — instance-based, one CopilotClient per mind
- **IdentityLoader** — SOUL.md parsing for agent identity
- **ExtensionLoader** — canvas, cron, IDEA adapters per mind
- **ConfigService** — persists `openMinds[]`, `activeMindId`, migration from v1
- **Sidebar** — agent list, click to switch, add/remove minds
- **IPC adapters** — thin one-liner handlers for chat, mind, lens, genesis, auth

## v0.14.0 (2026-04-10)

- **Packaging** — `npm run package` produces installable Electron app
- **Bundled Node runtime** — `scripts/prepare-node-runtime.js` for SDK in packaged builds

## v0.13.0 (2026-04-09)

### Auth & Credential Fixes
- **Fix OAuth client ID** — switch from deprecated `Iv1.b507a08c87ecfe98` to current CLI client ID `Ov23ctDVkRmgkPke0Mmm` with correct scopes (`read:user,read:org,repo,gist`)
- **Fix UTF-16/UTF-8 credential encoding** — cmdkey stores blobs as UTF-16LE but the CLI reads via keytar (UTF-8). Now uses Win32 `CredWriteW` directly with UTF-8 encoding via a compiled helper
- **Fix PowerShell Add-Type timeout** — replaced slow JIT compilation with a precompiled `CredWrite.exe` via `csc.exe` (cached on first run)

### Agent Identity & Personality
- **Agent identity injection** — ChatService loads SOUL.md + `.github/agents/*.agent.md` and injects them into the session via `systemMessage` customize mode
- **Replace SDK identity section** — agent's SOUL replaces the default "You are GitHub Copilot CLI" identity while preserving all tool instructions, safety, and environment context
- **Remove SDK tone override** — the "100 words or less" tone section was suppressing agent personality; removed so SOUL.md's Vibe section controls voice

### Genesis & Boot
- **Surface genesis errors** — boot screen now shows red error text with actionable hint instead of spinning forever on failure
- **Fix BootScreen crash** — React strict mode double-fired useEffect corrupting interval index; fixed with optional chaining and value capture

## v0.12.0 (2026-04-09)
